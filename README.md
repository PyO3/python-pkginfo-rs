Parse Python package metadata from sdist and bdists and etc.
A Rust port of the [pkginfo](https://pypi.org/project/pkginfo/) Python library.

## Installation

Add it to your ``Cargo.toml``:

```toml
[dependencies]
python-pkginfo = "0.6"
```

then you are good to go. If you are using Rust 2015 you have to add ``extern crate python_pkginfo`` to your crate root as well.

## Example

```rust
use python_pkginfo::Distribution;

fn main() {
    let dist = Distribution::new("path/to/package.whl").unwrap();
    println!("{:#?}", dist.metadata());
}
```
